# Jack's Home Assistant Addons
A small curation of addons for Home Assistant that I felt were missing from the main line up.

## Acknowledgements and Information
All addons are based on their respective docker images that are the property of their respective author(s). If you find these addons useful, **please consider contributing and/or donating to the author(s) of those projects.**

Shoutout to After Hours Coding for their [fantastic guide](https://afterhourscoding.wordpress.com/2023/01/21/making-your-own-home-assistant-add-on/) on creating Home Assistant addons!

**If you have a request for an addon, please raise an issue and I will look into it for you.** Alternative, use the [above guide](https://afterhourscoding.wordpress.com/2023/01/21/making-your-own-home-assistant-add-on/) along with the [Home Assistant developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/tutorial/) to give it a go yourself!
